I really enjoyed making this game. This was my first opportuntiy to use jQuery on my own to create a respnsive game. It challenged my use and understanding of the jQuery framework. The reason I enjoyed creating this one in particular so much is because I discovered work flow.
I put on some background music and began to pseudocode. Starting with the HTML layout and moving onto the CSS styles and finishing off with the Javascript. I got the entire game 90% done in one day and was very happy with myself. I think it was this day that made me realize how exciting creating stuff with lines of code can be.
